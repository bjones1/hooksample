# |docname| - Run-time hooks for PyInstaller
# ******************************************
#
# A *run-time hook* might be required for several modules,
# but of course should only run once.
# Also some module might require several *run-time hooks*.
# This is why *run-time hooks* are to be listed in the here.
#
# A run-time hooks data file consists of a single dictionary.
{
    # Each key is the name of a module.
    'pyi_hooksample': [
        # Each value is a list of run-time hooks to include for this
        # module. See :doc:`rthooks/pyi_rth_hooksample.py`.
